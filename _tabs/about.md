## How a Joke Changed My Career
Seven years ago I was told that, "there are two types of system administrators in the world, those who know PowerShell and, 'would you like fries 🍟 with that'" . . . and, I've been learning PowerShell ever since.

## About This Project
**Build automations your future teammates can read, trust, and extend.**

This blog is part of a broader effort to help PowerShell developers move beyond ad-hoc scripting and toward intentional, and maintainable automation engineering.

## The Philosophy
- **Clear code beats clever code.**
- **Reusable code deserves professional design.**

I believe automations should be engineered with the same care as any producation-grade software. It should be explicit, readable, testable, and built to last.

## The Role of AI
This project also attempts to explore a modern developers workflow where AI acts as a code review partner, not a code generator.

The goal is not to join the cargo cult of the "copy and paste AI" developer, but to __think__ with AI; to test assumptions, explore alternatives, and refine reasoning while maintaining full ownership of design and implementation.

**AI should amplify developer clarity, not replace it.**
